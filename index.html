    <h2>Some Info On My Cats</h2></div>

    <p>I am following suggested advise and making my solo build website about
    my cats.</p>

    <br><p>In order of Greatness, the cats I have owned as an adult are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Morris</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Padington</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Butter</h3>

    <p>Butter's favorite thing is to play with packing paper.  She also loves
        hunting, mostly rodents.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Padington</h3>
    <img src="./assets/padington.jpg">
    <p>Padington is new to us, we've only had him about two weeks now.  He will
        only eat wet food.  He likes the cat tower we got for him, so that worked
        out well.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Morris</h3>
    <img src="./assets/morris.jpg">
   <p>Sadly, Morris passed away in November (of 2018).  He was the greatest cat of all
       time, beloved by his owners as well as most of our neighbors.  He loved fighting
       and he once fought off a coyote.
   </p><br>

   <h3>Cat Problems</h3>
    <p>As much as I love my cats, they are living things that have issues and 
        don't always follow the instructions I give them.  The following is a list 
    of issues with/complications of owning cats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>they puke sometimes, sometimes on things they shouldn't</li>
        <li>cats think expensive new couch is expensive new scratching post</li>
        <li>they require paid supervision when owners go out of town</li>
        <li>They bring me dead things to eat that I don't want to eat</li>
        <li>They don't always understand about the importance of 8 hours of sleep</li>
    </ul>

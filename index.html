    <p>I am following suggested advise and making my solo build website about
    my cats.</p>

    <br><p>In order of Greatness, the cats I have owned as an adult are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Morris</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Padington</li>
        </ol>

    <p>As much as I love my cats, they are living things that have issues and 
        don't always follow the instructions I give them.  The following is a list 
    of issues with/complications of owning cats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>they puke sometimes, sometimes on things they shouldn't</li>
        <li>cats think expensive new couch is expensive new scratching post</li>
        <li>they require paid supervision when owners go out of town</li>
        <li>They bring me dead things to eat that I don't want to eat</li>
        <li>They don't always understand about the importance of 8 hours of sleep</li>
    </ul>
